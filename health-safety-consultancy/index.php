This also applies when a contractor employs subcontractors.</p>
          <p>If you are contracting construction work you have duties as a client under the Construction Design and Management Regulations 2015 (CDM).</p>
          <p>A client is anyone who has construction work carried out for them. Please see the CDM consultancy section of this website for more information relating to your duties under the CDM Regulations.</p>

          <p>In any business or organisation things don’t always go to plan. In the unfortunate event of an incident or Accident, Health &amp; Safety&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/managing/delivering/check/investigating-accidents-incidents.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigations</a>&nbsp;form an essential part of the monitoring process that you are required to carry out. Incidents, including near misses, can tell you a lot about how things actually are in reality. An investigation can help you identify why the existing risk control measures failed and what improvements or additional measures are needed so that you can ensure they do not reoccur.</p>
          <p>The process involved in investigating serious accidents may involve:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inspection of the accident/incident location and recording of evidence</li>
            <li>Inspection of site health and safety documentation in relation to the accident/incident</li>
            <li>Taking witness statements</li>
            <li>Interviewing injured parties</li>
            <li>Preparation of a full report indicating the root causes of the accident/incident and any recommendations required</li>
          </ul>

          <p>As mentioned above, if you are engaging a contractor to carry out works for your business, you have a responsibility to ensure they are competent to do so. A process based on the requirements of PAS 91 known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Pre-qualification_questionnaire_PQQ_for_construction_contracts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PQQ&nbsp;</a>and which includes a H&amp;S section, consists of the contractor completing and submitting a questionnaire and supporting documents to the organisation, where they are reviewed against a standard and if successful, the contractor is added to an approved contractor list for a certain period, but usually no longer than 12 months. The process is complicated for the client organisation due to the H&amp;S section, as the reviewer should be a H&amp;S competent person to ensure the review is suitable and sufficient. If you are not familiar with it, the process can be confusing, frustrating and time consuming.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Numerous large organisations that use hundreds, if not thousands of contractors, such as local authorities and private businesses, may not have the in-house resource to carry out the H&amp;S section of the PQQ review on all of the contractors on their approved list, therefore they require contractors that wish to work for them, to hold an&nbsp;<a href="https://ssip.org.uk/about-ssip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">SSIP&nbsp;</a><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">accreditation. This can be with any one of a number of SSIP providers such as Chas, SMAS, Constructionline, FASET, etc.<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">&nbsp;<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">A complete list of current providers can be found on the SSIP website linked above.</p>
          <p>We are experienced in the SSIP process and can assist you to gain accreditation with your chosen provider, or multiple providers if you choose. Depending on the level and extent of your existing H&amp;S management system, this can be as little as reviewing and updating some existing documents, up to providing almost all of the documentation and evidence you require to successfully get through the audit process.</p>
