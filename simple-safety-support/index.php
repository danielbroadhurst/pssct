    <h5>SIMPLE SAFETY SUPPORT SERVICES</h5>
    <div>
      <p>Managing Health &amp; Safety is a necessity for your business for moral, financial and legal reasons. Having robust and effective Health &amp; Safety management in place can also help to reduce staff turnover, insurance premiums, lost time, lost contracts and damage to your business’ reputation; can increase morale, reduce absences, result in greater productivity and ultimately, profitability.</p>
      <p>Our Simple Safety Support suite of H&amp;S packages help you to not only be legally compliant, but can also help to improve your business performance. You can read about how in this research paper. <a href="https://iosh.com/media/1576/the-impact-of-health-and-safety-management-on-organisations-and-their-staff-full-research-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="broken_link">The impact of health and safety management on organisations and their staff</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Simple Safety Support elements:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Onboarding gap analysis – this helps to identify both statutory and other supporting documentation necessary for your business’ H&amp;S needs – what you have versus what you need.</li>
      <li>H&amp;S document templates – These will include policies, procedures and risk assessments relevant to your organisation that may, depending on the package you choose, need to be further developed to suit your business undertakings.</li>
      <li>Risk Assessment – H&amp;S Regulations require the employer to undertake an assessment of risk on all hazards associated with their business. This includes common hazards like slips/trips, heating and lighting, access and egress, vehicle movements, etc., but also includes hazards identified in specific regulations like working at height, DSE, confined spaces and more. Depending on the package you take with us, we will either provide you a suite of templates for your specific business needs or, with your assistance, we will complete a range of risk assessments for you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to the services in your chosen package, we provide additional services to help enhance your management of Health &amp; Safety in your business.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Safety Inspections and Audits</li>
      <li>Training relevant to your business needs* (see our <a href="<?= BASE_URL ?>/nvqs/">NVQs and training</a> page for details of courses available)</li>
      <li>Qualifications in a variety of topics (see our <a href="<?= BASE_URL ?>/nvqs/">NVQs and training</a> page for details of courses available)<br></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3242/regulation/5/made">Accident Investigation</a></li>
      <li>Assistance with <a href="https://ssip.org.uk/">SSIP applications</a> (<a href="https://www.chas.co.uk/">Chas</a>, <a href="https://smasltd.com/">SMAS</a>, <a href="https://www.constructionline.co.uk/">Constructionline</a>, <a href="https://www.faset.org.uk/">FASET</a>, etc.)</li>
      <li>Assistance with the safety element of PQQs for tenders applications<br></li>
      <li>And more…</li>
    </ul>
    <div>*Training courses vary in duration and topic and may be mixed and matched to suit the needs of your organisation.</div>
    <div>
      <p>If you are unsure as to what you require, book a consultation with one of our H&amp;S professionals for a quick review of your current H&amp;S situation. A more detailed, documented report of what is required will require a full gap analysis which will identify and prioritise the actions you would need to take to ensure legal compliance relevant to your industry. We offer both one off services and on-going support and guidance to clients with an annual retained service.</p>
