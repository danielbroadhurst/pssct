            <p>In England and Wales, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 </a>&nbsp;applies to all workplaces (this includes construction sites) and common areas in residential premises where there is more than one residential dwelling.&nbsp; This Order requires the ‘<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/article/3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">responsible person</a>’, which includes any person who, by virtue of any contract or tenancy, has an obligation in relation to maintenance or repair of the premises, or anything in or on the premises, or the safety of the premises, for example contractors, to ensure the safety of all relevant persons that might be harmed by fire.</p>
            <p>As with all hazards, the first step to controlling it, is to first determine the risk, which is what the fire risk assessment aims to do.</p>
            <p>Aside from the legal requirement to carry out a fire risk assessment, a fire risk assessment helps you understand the potential risks and improve your fire safety precautions, so you can keep employees and visitors safe.</p>
            <p>We can conduct fire risk assessments on most premises which come under the requirements of the Order. Get in touch today to discuss your fire risk assessment needs.</p>

The plan describes the arrangements for effectively managing fire safety so as to prevent fire occurring and, in the event of fire, to protect people and property.</p>
            <p>The fire safety management plan consists of the adopted evacuation strategy and fire safety training specific to the building staff employed to work there, addressing any specific fire risks within the premises and detailing particular duties which should be performed during an evacuation for certain staff and the company policy and procedures to be implemented, such as maintaining compliance with fire risk assessments; maintenance and testing of internal systems; implementing in house fire door checks; arranging planned preventative maintenance (PPM) schedules for the fire protection systems and any other relevant services; management of contractors and creating hot work permits etc.</p>
            <p>We can assist you to put all of this information into a coherent fire safety management plan to help ensure you are appropriately managing fire risks in your business, or review/update your existing fire management plan to ensure it remains fit for purpose.</p>
