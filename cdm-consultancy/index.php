        <p class="mb-8">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/51/contents/made" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015</a>, also known as The CDM Regulations or CDM 2015, are regulations governing the way construction projects of all sizes and types are planned in the UK. Replacing Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007, CDM 2015 is the latest update to the regulations that aim to improve the overall health, safety and welfare of those working in construction.</p>
        <p class="mb-8">CDM 2015 places legal duties on all involved in a construction project; duties which are enforceable by criminal law; however, statistics published claim up to 85% of businesses affected by the regulations do not consider themselves to be in the construction industry.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-8">The definition of what constitutes ‘construction work’ (which is found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/51/regulation/2/made" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>), is quite broad under the regulations, so if you believe the project you are planning is subject to CDM 2015, please see below for the services we offer to help you ensure you are compliant with your statutory duties.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-8">Further information about CDM 2015 and duty holders can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citb.co.uk/about-citb/partnerships-and-initiatives/construction-design-and-management-regulations-2015/cdm-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>A CDM Consultant/CDM Advisor is a construction health and safety professional who provides advice, assistance and guidance to statutory duty holders (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/51/regulation/2/made" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Client, Principal Designer, Principal Contractor, Designers, Contractors</a>), under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/51/contents/made" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015</a>&nbsp;(CDM 2015), to ensure they comply with their statutory duties so that health and safety is an integral part of the project.</p>
            <p>In addition to the client seeking the help of a CDM Consultant to assist in fulfilling their duties, it is common for the lead Designer to agree to undertake the appointed role of Principal Designer, but where they do not have in house Health &amp; Safety expertise, to engage a CDM consultant to assist with the H&amp;S functions of that role on their behalf.</p>
            <p>With a qualified CDM client advisor on your team, you can ensure that each project runs smoothly from start to finish. A CDM advisor will provide crucial guidance in the design process and help you meet all legal requirements for a successful build.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Contractors will also often take on the appointed Principal Contractor role and engage a CDM client advisor to assist with fulfilling their specific CDM duties during a project. These are roles that we can assist with.</p>
            <div>
              <div>The CDM advisor role then, can range from being one of purely providing advice and clarification of the requirements of CDM, to assisting with/undertaking some of the duties on behalf of the particular duty holder.</div>
              <div>There is no specific scope for this role as this will depend on what is required by the particular duty holder; however, some of the duties we can fulfil on behalf of the duty holder are:</div>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>Client<ul>
                  <li>Determine competence of designers/contractors prior to appointment</li>

            <p>As part of these regular, usually monthly, CDM Compliance inspections, we will visit the construction site unannounced, carry out an inspection of CDM documentation which should be available at all times on site, and conduct a rigorous Health &amp; Safety site inspection. A detailed report with prioritised, recommended remedial actions (where applicable), and photos of both poor and good practice will be provided for your records, helping you to ensure this duty is complied with and giving you peace of mind.</p>
